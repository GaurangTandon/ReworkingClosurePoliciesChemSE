## What effort do I need to do before asking a question?

Here's the general rule:  

> **Before asking a question, do _anything_ else you can think of that might get you the answer.**  
  
In particular, you should probably do **all** of the following before asking here:  
  
- _Think_ about the question. What do you already know that relates to it? The most important step is to **narrow it down to the specific chemistry concept** you are really asking about or are confused by.  
- Type the question title into [Google](http://www.google.com) (and/or another good-quality search engine) and look at the top few (at least 5-10) results.   Also search a few combinations of key words, and again look at the top few results.  
- Identify what chemistry concepts are involved and look at the relevant [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) pages.  
- Look in a textbook or equivalent resource on the appropriate subject. If you don't have actual textbooks, there are plenty of online resources, like [Chemistry LibreTexts](https://chem.libretexts.org/), that you can use.  
- If you're asking a more advanced question which concerns current research, look for relevant papers, including checking on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org). You may find it useful to use a dedicated scientific search engine, such as [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).  
- Also, when you're typing your question in the form, look at the suggested similar questions the system shows you.  

- **Especially for physical chemistry questions**: You must<sup>3</sup> show all the calculation steps involved, with proper reasoning as to why each step was performed. Also, a question about mixing 15ml NaOH with 10ml HCl isn't really different from mixing 10ml NaOH with 15ml HCl. Since numbers tend to change very often, you should also look for the similar questions. 
  
If you find the answer to your question while doing all this research, great! You can, if you want, post your question here (if it's not already on the site) along with your own answer describing what you found. See: [Can I answer my own question?](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer)  

## But why do you want me to show effort in the first place?
That is primarily because of the reason that we want to help _you_, not the person who set your textbook questions. Doing the latter would simply involve us dumping all the knowledge we have in a large monologue, solving the question, and giving you back the answer. However, that doesn't help _you_ in any way. 

When students fail to solve a question completely, that implies they've a conceptual problem at one or more steps. We're here to help _you_, with those specific conceptual queries that _you_ have. That would help you learn, and not repeat the mistake again in the future as well.

Therefore, **it's required that you explain why you think the step - that the answer key gives as incorrect - should be correct instead.**<sup>3</sup> (or vice-versa) That also gives us a glimpse of your understanding of the concepts, and helps us explain it in a proper, comprehensive way. For example, you may only have a small inconsistency at one step, but without knowing your complete thought process, the answer will be all the way from the beginning.


## OK, I didn't find the answer. Now what?  
  
If your prior research didn't give the answer you were looking for, **tell us what you checked**. Don't explicitly list each one of the steps above to say that you followed it, but do mention anything you found that is close to the topic of your question, and point out why it didn't give you the answer you wanted. If someone reads your question and immediately finds a standard resource (Google search, Wikipedia, Chemistry LibreTexts, another SE question) that seems to answer it, it's going to look like you didn't do your research, unless you explain why that resource doesn't actually contain the information you're looking for.  
  
## What if I think I know what the answer is?  
  
If you have a guess or hypothesis about the answer to your question (one that is grounded in solid physics), that's fine, but you should go out and check that hypothesis yourself. Maybe it'll be correct, in which case you can post the question here with your hypothesis (and the evidence that shows it's correct) as an answer. If you think it's incorrect, on the other hand, mention it in the question and say why you think it's wrong. A question that just ends on "My hypothesis is XXXX" comes across as lazy, but if you instead write "My hypothesis is XXXX, but that doesn't seem correct because Wikipedia says YYYYY," and so on, that shows research effort and makes a better question.  

## What happens if I don't follow these guidelines?  
  
People trying to answer your question will follow the steps in the first section: they'll search Google, check on Wikipedia, on LibreTexts, in textbooks, and do some simple calculations if it's that type of a question. If, by performing such simple steps, they find the answer to your question, they're likely to downvote your question for not showing research effort. You may also get comments pointing you to the answer on Wikipedia or a top search result.  
  
Questions that show a particular lack of research effort may be put on hold (or "closed"). In many of these cases, we advice the poster to rework their question following the advice they got in the comments may be useful in improving the question enough to have it reopened, and edit their posts. Posts edited when they're [on hold] are sent for review by high rep users, who may vote to Reopen the vote. If the reopen fails, however, you may always ask on meta for further help. [Users do post](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4193/5026) a few times, and if the request is put forward properly, it gives positive results.<sup>[1]</sup>  
  
Please note that a "low-effort" closure is not an insult nor a punishment. It is not even directed at _you_, but rather at the content. In fact, we'll be

**Thoughts:**

1. Could be better if we got an example for a [homework] closed meta post instead, but this will suffice for the time being. Looking for something like [this](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3317/why-is-this-homework-question-still-closed?rq=1), but being posted by the actual user involved.**
2. I removed the following point that was present in the original Phy.Meta.SE post:

   > "If you have friends, colleagues, teachers, or so on who would know something about your question, ask them for input.
  
   This is difficult to verify. Are teachers and friends reliable citation? And if we had such friends, we probably have asked them before, but they probably gave us some incorrect/misleading advice, and that's why we're on Chem.SE. So, it really isn't worth asking them.
3. Note to CVers: I've written that it's _required_, but please don't take it set in stone. If a question and its underlying problem is understandably obvious, like [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/39315/dipole-moments-of-pyrrole-and-furan), please just leave it open.
