## Ideas that need discussion.

### How can we shorten the "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?" document?

We cannot really expect the new users to read all of that. Even though it's very streamlined and contains the most essential and comprehensive information in one place, any new user will probably be intimidated by its scale.

**Proposed solution:** we don't need to link new users to that document at all in the beginning. It should only serve as a standing guide, intended to direct non-users to our general site policy. Our first pro-forma comment to a new user should be along the lines of that described under "Problem 4" above. If they get back later with a vague effort, only the point them to that policy document. If their question gets closed, they'll read the policy anyway, and if they aren't homework vampires, make necessary edits.

### How to deal with "How to" question?/"I don't understand how to do this. Help?"

The OP in such cases clearly isn't a homework vampire. They don't want to plug the values and get the answer by tonight. Rather, they took time to put up a generic enough question that could deserve a good answer, and be useful in bringing more visitors to our site.

[thomji](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/435) had an important idea here:

> If...., then we need to make the requirements very clear in the HW policy. For example "You must provide the equation and show that you can plug the appropriate numbers in" or "you must demonstrate that you can work through at least one step of the problem." The **downside to this is that we will likely discourage many people who are completely stuck and don't even know where to get started.** That might be a desired outcome, but **I believe there is value in providing "how to" examples for common problems,** in that it will draw many more users to the site, who will (hopefully) in a few years become experts themselves. (my emphasis)

We already have such "how to" questions open on our site. A good example being [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/58104).

They clearly don't demonstrate much effort in the sense that they themselves are the fundamental steps in understanding a concept. There's nothing below them.

However, we also don't to answer every second fundamental, and fill our site with the already good content from sites like LibreTexts or Khan Academy (for example, doing the derivation of every second equation in ionic equilibrium). That job is reserved for the other teaching sites.

**Proposed solution** The above described low-effort rules apply (under **tl;dr** above). 

<sup>debatable</sup>need a third custom close reason for this? Or will a new proforma comment be enough?

> We are not a tutoring service. Broad questions lacking clarity in understanding fundamental concepts are better answered by a teaching source like a textbook/Khan Academy/etc. If you've a specific query that isn't answered by any of these sources, please [edit] your question to detail that.

### Reopens don't always succeed, even in clear cut cases. Flag them for mod-reopening?

Mods do drop by time to time in the reopen queue, and hammer reopen "homework" closed questions (and quite rightly so) that have been later edited. (or were wrongly closed). It would be nice to hear of an exact policy they would want us to follow though in case the reopen fails as well.

### How to deal with honest questions from people with non-chemistry background working in other industries?

> For example, [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40840/how-to-calculate-the-amount-of-citric-acid-to-neutralise-the-ph-within-wastewate). OP didn't do much research before posting the question, so from one perspective the question could be closed by the [extended "homework" VTC reason](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/142/11367). However, the question clearly derives from someone's industrial experience, and perhaps they don't have much of a chemistry background or have much interest in learning chemistry for chemistry's sake. Does that mean we should answer, even in the face of the lack of research, since it's a real-world problem that someone has encountered? Or should, e.g., a potential lack of interest in the chemistry on the part of the OP bias us even more strongly toward closure?

([hBy2Py/Brian](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3187))

Do we hold them to the same standards as we expect normal chemistry questions to be? Obviously, this would alienate our community to people with not a good chemistry background, which is bad.

**Proposed solution:**

Be lenient on them. As long as they are well-described and straightforward, leave them open. They aren't clearly an "homework assignment". We don't have an influx of hundreds of industrial questions at this point, so we can let them be open.

### Possibly review this again - AMIRITE questions?

We could review the two old policies we already have, because they written in the homework-era of our site. [one](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1626/what-should-be-done-with-is-my-calculation-correct-type-questions) and [two](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3396/policy-on-amirite-questions?noredirect=1&lq=1)

Also, good thoughts:

> "check my math" questions should be closed, but ones along the lines of "did I set this up right?" or "am I using this equation correctly?" may provide useful material. The difficult ones are actually when they  _have_  done it correctly, because then there's not much to post as an answer but "Yes," except in cases, e.g., where OP has some uncertainties or ancillary questions that can be addressed. ([hBy2Py/Brian](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3181/lets-decide-on-what-we-should-close-as-homework#comment2985_3183))

### Possibly review these again - Data request questions?

Last policy discussion was [in '16](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/should-we-allow-data-questions). However, there definitely doesn't seem to be some consensus there.

**New proposed solution:**

1. third custom close reason: plain straightforward data mining requests are off-topic. (similar to that on German.SE, dictionary/thesaurus requests are offtopic)
2. a reference wiki post on our main site on where to look for different types of data (acidity tables/etc.) (which we should also cite in our custom close reason in point 1)
3. However, if the question has **some genuine premises** (as was the case in [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/92507/a-basic-question-about-tetramethylammonium-hydroxide), or as described in [andselisk's answer](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3875)), which cannot be helped by the reference wiki post we would have on our main site, we shouldn't close them as data mining off topic.
