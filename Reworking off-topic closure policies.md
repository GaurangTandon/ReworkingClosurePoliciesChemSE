### Intro:

There have already been calls to summarize our close reasons and lay them out objectively, in that they should be more of actionable and decidable than fuzzy and subject to interpretation. [example](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3187/5026):

> In both cases, I would argue that structured frameworks need to be implemented for:
>  1. Identifying the specific things to be discussed
>  1. Putting each specific thing before the community for discussion
>  1. Evaluating the position of the community on each specific thing
>  1. Aggregating the community positions into a coherent form
>  1. Distilling the aggregated community positions into, e.g., vote-to-close reasons and meta posts
>  1. ...?

Instead,  discussions on homework have often been long winded, turning into questions about high school level questions, to those about data mining, etc. There has never really been a comprehensive stance on every single proper point. This post is a culmination of all those words of wisdom from the past four-five years, and an effort to formulae them as community guidelines. The post is undoubtedly long, as it also touches a lot of topics that are often closed/discussed as homework when they shouldn't be.

**Thoughts:** to make sure that we're at least all on the same bus:

> The way of asking and answering HW questions should be such that benefits the asker and the answerer and stops future unwanted consequences of accepting homework questions. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3012/what-is-a-homework-question))
> 
> 
> **Let's not fit all of the low quality questions into the sack of being closable as homework.**  The less Jack-of-all-trades a close reason is, the better guidance and moderation will be. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3181/lets-decide-on-what-we-should-close-as-homework))
> 
> The whole idea of _useful for the OP_ should be completely eradicated from our thinking. **The individual does not matter, only the content does.** I couldn't care less if I'm doing someones homework or not. It's not my problem if the OP learns or not. If a question is interesting, well presented, and helpful for a certain number of people I don't care where it came from and if someone gets a good grade for it. It's about broad applicability, which most of those copy and paste exercises simply lack.

## **Problem 1 - Misinterpreted usage of the word "homework"**

We currently are in decent consensus over what constitutes "homework". These are:  

1. Blatant textbook problem statement, in imperative speech (aka, a "**homework vampire**"): [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074341/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95492/rf-value-by-paper-chromatography), [eg](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95488/flowchart-question)
2. A restatement of the textbook problem, from the asker's perspective, but still with negligible effort: [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074533/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95471/which-carbonyl-group-gets-reduced-and-how), [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180501160824/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/96169/does-the-number-of-oxidation-depend-on-the-stoichiometry-of-the-reaction)
3. Poster's own thought, not a textbook assignment, but which they posted without any effort: [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074142/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95324/gas-releasing-from-a-cylinder)  

We've been closing all of these as "homework". Assuming that the closure was warranted in all these cases, there is one problem that clearly sticks out: closing questions which aren't homework as "homework" (aka, point 3 above)

A simple Google search gives us:  

> **homework**: (noun) schoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home.

Note that point 3 isn't homework, but we tell people that it is! This confuses, and sometimes [enrages OPs](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074142/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95324/gas-releasing-from-a-cylinder#comment175226_95324). It doesn't do us any good in using a <strike>poorly-</strike>**wrongly**-worded close reason.  To quote [Martin](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3160) (modified-emphasis):

> What is a 'homework question'?...I really think it is the wrong question to ask.   The term itself comes with the perception that it is an assignment.... Often it is not. It might be part of some self-study, just some exercise from a book, a riddle in a magazine.... **Things like that are covered with our current policy, but not reflected in the name. This is why one of the common replies is: "This is not homework."   I want to get rid of this. I want to throw anything and everything under the bus.** 

People have already been confused by the definition before <sup>[read](https://web.archive.org/web/20180430040808/https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-chemistry-stack-exchange#comment4763_142)</sup>, but we had continued with it nonetheless. And now this needs to be fixed. (Also, read the document "Origins of Homework Policy in Our Community")

**Solution: a general purpose "no-effort" close reason** 

The [conclusion of the experiment](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3837/5026) also suggested that we love using the term "no-effort" in closing such questions. The problem before us is that we give homework a separate treatment. Why is homework given a separate treatment in the first place?  In fact, there has been [disagreement over this before](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3018) (modified emphasis):

>  **"What is a 'homework question'?" may be the wrong question to ask.**  
> This comes out of the thought that 'homework' is the wrong word for it. ...
> **Better Question: What is it about 'homework questions' that we don't like?**
> **It's not "homework" _per se_ that we're cautious about, it's more other features of the question which make it a bad one** for the site - which is why questions which aren't literally homework are still considered to be "homework questions". The key is not so much figuring out what is "homework", but determining what it _actually_ is that we're against when we're against "homework questions". If we can define that, hopefully the definition of what is a "homework question" (and if there is a better name for it) should fall out naturally.

The problem with closing questions as "homework" is that it indicates what the question _is_, not the _reason_ it was closed for. I hope we all can agree that even homework questions can be nicely asked and be well-ontopic, while even non-homework questions can be badly asked, and be closed. In both the cases, "good questions" are those where the OP shows effort, while the bad ones are those where the OP hasn't. **Homework questions should be treated the same way as any general question on our site is treated i.e. low-effort question => CV it; good-effort question: leave open** (more on determining effort below this post)

That, and we all should drop the usage of the word "homework" altogether, as its usage on our site differs radically from its intended definition in the dictionary and elsewhere on the internet. We should only use it, if at all, to indicate what it actually means, not what we had pre-supposed it should mean (but actually doesn't). As for the actual close reason, it should be called "low-effort".

## Problem 2: the homework policy doesn't objectively state what the asker actually needs to do

It just quite broadly emphasizes that the person needs to narrow it down to a specific chemistry concept, but doesn't actually explain that objectively enough. To better demonstrate my point, read the new "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?" document, and then compare its objective, concise, easy-to-follow bullet points with the vague paragraphs of our current policy.

## Problem 3: the homework policy was/is often used as a dump for "I don't like this question/too basic", let's VTC!

Well, the quotations are enough for this problem:

> It seems we're more inclined to send a "I don't like this question and I don't want it answered" message across than guide users, which is unfortunate. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3712/are-we-a-bit-overzealous-with-closing-questions-as-homework))

> I agree that there is definitely a double standard when it comes to "basic" vs "advanced" questions. Most of the misuse of the homework close reason is probably on questions being too basic, although I believe it goes beyond that as well ([orthocresol](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3712/are-we-a-bit-overzealous-with-closing-questions-as-homework#comment5606_3722), also the entire answer above this, too long to quote)

> Sometimes, I felt like people thought: "hmm, I don't like this question, let's just flag/close it as HW". And the vagueness of the HW policy meant that it was very open to interpretation, and nearly everything could be closed under it. It became a catch-all reason to close any question that five people with 3k+ rep didn't like....In hindsight, I think that **if there are questions that we (as a community) dislike and want to close, then they should be closed.** I am not trying to say that our dislike for them is unjustified. **But, we do need to figure out the correct close reason for them**.... ([orthocresol](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3341/feedback-on-the-experiment), modified emphasis)

Fwiw, the "low-effort" should also not be used for such types of closures. If there's a question _you_ don't like or _you_ think it's too basic, just downvote it. Instead, if you see a regular pattern of a certain type of questions, that you would want the _entire community_ to not accept (i.e., be closed) on the site, detail them out properly (specific traits with example posts) in a new meta post.

## Problem 4: the tone of our homework close reason is more strict than it needs to be

> **Homework questions**  must demonstrate some effort to understand the underlying concepts. For help asking a good homework question, see: ...

is way more strict/punishing(/demotivating(any other suitable word?) and would make the user feel as if they did not actually demonstrate any effort solving the problem. Note that the way we're used to expecting demonstrated effort could be substantially different from the way the users are expected to in their real life. The current close reason instead actively/deliberately tells people that they did not at all give the problem any effort, even though they might have been brainstorming for over an hour on the problem, just that they might not know how to demonstrate effort properly to us.

**Proposed solution**; rename the "homework" close reason to:

  > "**This question is missing context or other details**: Please [improve the question](meta_post) by providing additional context, which ideally includes your thoughts on the problem and any attempts you have made to solve it. This information helps others identify where you have difficulties and helps them write answers appropriate to your experience level."

   The tone of this close reason (copied from Math.SE) is actually better as it does not appear to be insulting or punitive to the user involved. 

Moreover,  we would need to change our pro-forma comments. No more telling posters straight in their face "This is a homework question. We require..." Instead a general tone: "Hi [username], welcome to Chem.SE! We require you to show your efforts on this problem. What formulae/steps did you try? Where did you get stuck? Please add this to your question. Thanks!" (can be decided in detail later)

## Related ideas:

### Short questions and low effort questions: correlation, but not a causality
  
A low effort question means not having as much effort _as required in that context._ Low effort questions being short as well is a correlation, but not a causality. Even lengthy questions may be low-effort, so we shouldn't use length as a determining factor.  
  
For example, in [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/39315/dipole-moments-of-pyrrole-and-furan), it is clear the OP understands why what he's asking is a problem in the first place. There isn't any need for elaboration. Of course, a bit of that could have helped, but that really isn't necessary. The question is salvaged and understood.  
  
[This question](https://web.archive.org/web/20180430024711/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95999/principles-of-valence-shell-electron-pair-repulsion) instead is longer, yet, is clearly an imperative homework vampire.  This is another [low effort question](http://web.archive.org/web/20180429124744/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95913/graph-between-compressibility-factor-and-pressure-for-real-and-ideal-gases) that I likely wouldn't want to answer, but it seems very similar to Marko's question.  It has a fundamental conceptual problem to it, better answered by a textbook/Google searches.

### **What is the philosophy/motivation behind closing low effort stuff?**

1. It helps in quality control. We want our content to be high quality or medium quality, but certainly not even 20% of it as low quality.
2. It keeps the experts coming back. High schoolers cannot shoulder the content on this site. They have way too many misconceptions,  and don't know enough details/depth in any particular topic, so it's very important to have the experts around. 

### **Verifying sufficient effort in grey-area questions:**

If we keep lax standards, we might end up like Math.SE - too many useless questions with one or two answers and zero future usefulness. However, if we don't keep any objective standard at all, we will end up confusing ourselves as before. Specific questions would be brought up on meta, why's this low effort, why isn't this low effort, would be asked again and again, exhausting ourselves out.
  
So the next problem is: **verifying sufficient effort.** The definition for effort is directly contained in "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?#But why do you want me to show effort in the first place?". We need effort to help OPs in their original conceptual queries. But, **how much effort is sufficient?** The following is an attempt at breaking down this subjective enquiry into an objective number of easy-to-follow steps:

**tl;dr**: If the OP's question can be answered by any of the [credible sources](https://github.com/GaurangTandon/ReworkingClosurePoliciesChemSE/blob/master/Ideas%20that%20need%20discussion.md#sources-we-consider-credible-that-we-expect-readers-to-check-out-before-asking-a-question) and be explicitly found within thirty seconds of Googling, use a proforma comment to  put a link to that source and to request the OP to edit their question in case that doesn't answer their query, and put a CV. Or if it is a "homework vampire" question, put a CV. Otherwise, do not CV.
  
1. **If the answer can be found in a textbook, the question should probably _not_ be closed (subject to other conditions below)**. We cannot expect every second student to have access to the best book out there. Hence, even if their question is answered in a book, it's probably better to answer it, and not close, as long as they meet other requirements below.
2. **If the topic can be Googled and the answer _found_ within thirty seconds, it's probably worth a close vote. But else, definitely not.** Also, in the first case, please do put a small comment linking to a page that explains that topic (the source must be credible though), and ask them to show more effort. It's most annoying when we see an item in the CV queue, but have no clue why someone thought of close voting it. A small comment would help the OP as well as the CV reviewers. In the absence of such comment, CV reviewers may use their own discretion, and lean towards Leave Open. Again, this has caveats:
    1. **if the answer can be _implicitly understood_, but not _explicitly found_, on aweb article, then it's **not** worth a close vote,** as we cannot assume what is implicit to us to be implicit to everyone else.
    2. If the answer is on a non-credible site, do not CV it.
3. **Keep your expectations in accordance with the standard of the OP:** If the OP is a high-schooler, it would not make sense to link them to a research paper, and tell them how their question is low-effort. However, if the question is about a graduate topic, we should expect the OP to be a bit more detailed and mature in their question. 
4. **Blatant textbook problem statements in imperative speech ("homework vampires"): definitely a close-vote** We don't need to do anything apart from hammer closing them. No greetings, or welcome messages compulsory, or explanations in comments necessary.
  
Again, please use your discretion and common sense. We definitely have an influx of bad questions everyday, but we also are too trigger-happy in closing questions.<sup>stats needed, but well understood</sup> **While reviewing some stuff, if your mind stops even for a second to debate whether it's low effort or not, it's better then to not put the close vote in, and vote Leave Open.** We should lean towards the side of leaving that grey area stuff open, rather than closing on it.
