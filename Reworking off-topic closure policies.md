### Intro:

There have already been calls to summarize our close reasons and lay them out objectively, in that they should be more of actionable and decidable than fuzzy and subject to interpretation. [example](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3187/5026):

> In both cases, I would argue that structured frameworks need to be implemented for:
>  1. Identifying the specific things to be discussed
>  1. Putting each specific thing before the community for discussion
>  1. Evaluating the position of the community on each specific thing
>  1. Aggregating the community positions into a coherent form
>  1. Distilling the aggregated community positions into, e.g., vote-to-close reasons and meta posts
>  1. ...?

Instead,  discussions on homework have often been long winded, turning into questions about high school level questions, to those about data mining, etc. There has never really been a comprehensive stance on every single proper point. This post is a culmination of all those words of wisdom from the past four-five years, and an effort to formulae them as community guidelines. The post is undoubtedly long, as it also touches a lot of topics that are often closed/discussed as homework when they shouldn't be.

**Thoughts:** to make sure that we're at least all on the same bus:

> The way of asking and answering HW questions should be such that benefits the asker and the answerer and stops future unwanted consequences of accepting homework questions. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3012/what-is-a-homework-question))
> 
> 
> **Let's not fit all of the low quality questions into the sack of being closable as homework.**  The less Jack-of-all-trades a close reason is, the better guidance and moderation will be. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3181/lets-decide-on-what-we-should-close-as-homework))
> 
> The whole idea of _useful for the OP_ should be completely eradicated from our thinking. **The individual does not matter, only the content does.** I couldn't care less if I'm doing someones homework or not. It's not my problem if the OP learns or not. If a question is interesting, well presented, and helpful for a certain number of people I don't care where it came from and if someone gets a good grade for it. It's about broad applicability, which most of those copy and paste exercises simply lack. ([Martin](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3718/the-homework-close-reason-another-example-of-over-zealous-closure-and-a-propos#comment5597_3720))

## **Problem 1 - Misinterpreted usage of the word "homework"**

We currently are in decent consensus over what constitutes "homework". These are:  

1. Blatant textbook problem statement, in imperative speech (aka, a "**homework vampire**"): [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074341/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95492/rf-value-by-paper-chromatography), [eg](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95488/flowchart-question)
2. A restatement of the textbook problem, from the asker's perspective, but still with negligible effort: [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074533/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95471/which-carbonyl-group-gets-reduced-and-how), [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180501160824/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/96169/does-the-number-of-oxidation-depend-on-the-stoichiometry-of-the-reaction)
3. Poster's own thought, not a textbook assignment, but which they posted without any effort: [eg](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074142/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95324/gas-releasing-from-a-cylinder)  

We've been closing all of these as "homework". Assuming that the closure was warranted in all these cases, there is one problem that clearly sticks out: closing questions which aren't homework as "homework" (aka, point 3 above)

A simple Google search gives us:  

> **homework**: (noun) schoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home.

Note that point 3 isn't homework, but we tell people that it is! This confuses, and sometimes [enrages OPs](https://web.archive.org/web/20180419074142/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95324/gas-releasing-from-a-cylinder#comment175226_95324). It doesn't do us any good in using a <strike>poorly-</strike>**wrongly**-worded close reason.  To quote [Martin](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3160) (modified-emphasis):

> What is a 'homework question'?...I really think it is the wrong question to ask.   The term itself comes with the perception that it is an assignment.... Often it is not. It might be part of some self-study, just some exercise from a book, a riddle in a magazine.... **Things like that are covered with our current policy, but not reflected in the name. This is why one of the common replies is: "This is not homework."   I want to get rid of this. I want to throw anything and everything under the bus.** 

People have already been confused by the definition before <sup>[read](https://web.archive.org/web/20180430040808/https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-chemistry-stack-exchange#comment4763_142)</sup>, but we had continued with it nonetheless. And now this needs to be fixed. (Also, read the document "Origins of Homework Policy in Our Community")

**Solution: a general purpose "no-effort" close reason** 

The [conclusion of the experiment](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3837/5026) also suggested that we love using the term "no-effort" in closing such questions. The problem before us is that we give homework a separate treatment. Why is homework given a separate treatment in the first place?  In fact, there has been [disagreement over this before](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3018) (modified emphasis):

>  **"What is a 'homework question'?" may be the wrong question to ask.**  
> This comes out of the thought that 'homework' is the wrong word for it. ...
> **Better Question: What is it about 'homework questions' that we don't like?**
> **It's not "homework" _per se_ that we're cautious about, it's more other features of the question which make it a bad one** for the site - which is why questions which aren't literally homework are still considered to be "homework questions". The key is not so much figuring out what is "homework", but determining what it _actually_ is that we're against when we're against "homework questions". If we can define that, hopefully the definition of what is a "homework question" (and if there is a better name for it) should fall out naturally.

The problem with closing questions as "homework" is that it indicates what the question _is_, not the _reason_ it was closed for. I hope we all can agree that even homework questions can be nicely asked and be well-ontopic, while even non-homework questions can be badly asked, and be closed. In both the cases, "good questions" are those where the OP shows effort, while the bad ones are those where the OP hasn't. **Homework questions should be treated the same way as any general question on our site is treated i.e. low-effort question => CV it; good-effort question: leave open** (more on determining effort below this post)

That, and we all should drop the usage of the word "homework" altogether, as its usage on our site differs radically from its intended definition in the dictionary and elsewhere on the internet. We should only use it, if at all, to indicate what it actually means, not what we had pre-supposed it should mean (but actually doesn't). As for the actual close reason, it should be called "low-effort".

## Problem 2: the homework policy doesn't objectively state what the asker actually needs to do

It just quite broadly emphasizes that the person needs to narrow it down to a specific chemistry concept, but doesn't actually explain that objectively enough. To better demonstrate my point, read the new "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?" document, and then compare its objective, concise, easy-to-follow bullet points with the vague paragraphs of our current policy.

## Problem 3: the homework policy was/is often used as a dump for "I don't like this question/too basic", let's VTC!

Well, the quotations are enough for this problem:

> It seems we're more inclined to send a "I don't like this question and I don't want it answered" message across than guide users, which is unfortunate. ([MAR](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3712/are-we-a-bit-overzealous-with-closing-questions-as-homework))

> I agree that there is definitely a double standard when it comes to "basic" vs "advanced" questions. Most of the misuse of the homework close reason is probably on questions being too basic, although I believe it goes beyond that as well ([orthocresol](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3712/are-we-a-bit-overzealous-with-closing-questions-as-homework#comment5606_3722), also the entire answer above this, too long to quote)

> Sometimes, I felt like people thought: "hmm, I don't like this question, let's just flag/close it as HW". And the vagueness of the HW policy meant that it was very open to interpretation, and nearly everything could be closed under it. It became a catch-all reason to close any question that five people with 3k+ rep didn't like....In hindsight, I think that **if there are questions that we (as a community) dislike and want to close, then they should be closed.** I am not trying to say that our dislike for them is unjustified. **But, we do need to figure out the correct close reason for them**.... ([orthocresol](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3341/feedback-on-the-experiment), modified emphasis)

Fwiw, the "low-effort" should also not be used for such types of closures. If there's a question _you_ don't like or _you_ think it's too basic, just downvote it. Instead, if you see a regular pattern of a certain type of questions, that you would want the _entire community_ to not accept (i.e., be closed) on the site, detail them out properly (specific traits with example posts) in a new meta post.

## Problem 4: the tone of our homework close reason is more strict than it needs to be

> **Homework questions**  must demonstrate some effort to understand the underlying concepts. For help asking a good homework question, see: ...

is way more strict/punishing(/demotivating(any other suitable word?) and would make the user feel as if they did not actually demonstrate any effort solving the problem. Note that the way we're used to expecting demonstrated effort could be substantially different from the way the users are expected to in their real life. The current close reason instead actively/deliberately tells people that they did not at all give the problem any effort, even though they might have been brainstorming for over an hour on the problem, just that they might not know how to demonstrate effort properly to us.

**Proposed solution**; rename the "homework" close reason to:

  > "**This question is missing context or other details**: Please [improve the question](meta_post) by providing additional context, which ideally includes your thoughts on the problem and any attempts you have made to solve it. This information helps others identify where you have difficulties and helps them write answers appropriate to your experience level."

   The tone of this close reason (copied from Math.SE) is actually better as it does not appear to be insulting or punitive to the user involved. 

Moreover,  we would need to change our pro-forma comments. No more telling posters straight in their face "This is a homework question. We require..." Instead a general tone: "Hi [username], welcome to Chem.SE! We require you to show your efforts on this problem. What formulae/steps did you try? Where did you get stuck? Please add this to your question. Thanks!" (can be decided in detail later)

## Related ideas:


### Please don't VTC because a question is poorly formatted. Rather, encourage and improve new OP's questions
Well, this is probably tangential, but let's just repeat it. The idea of showing "effort" might entirely be foreign to new users.  They might be used to dumping questions to their tutor first, and then being guided step-by-step later. So, please use the ProFormaTemplates comments (or whichever way you find appropriate) to request them for elaboration. Of course, seeing several bad questions in a day might leave a bad taste, but we must assume good intentions from and be nice to new posters, every single time. If we are tired/worn out, we should probably skip reviewing stuff that day.

Moreover, fixing MathJax /formatting is an important issue. **If you are inclined to put a close vote just because a question is poorly formatted, it's a big NO!** Consider editing the OP's question instead to make it clearer. If it still misses out one or more fronts (too broad/opinion based/low-effort/etc.), feel free to VTC it. However, **if you're too busy to edit, just skip the close vote.** We all have priorities, and there's no harm in skipping an edit if you aren't comfortable completing it. However, **VTCing just based on the formatting should be a big NO**.

### Please don't VTC because a question's easy and got answered in comments

[It happens quite frequently.](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/43872590#43872590)

This may appear nice to some, after all, you helped the OP get the solution even if their question did not belong to our site. However, this has quite a few bad implications: 

1. users will assume that even if they post poorly formatted questions, it would get answered by someone
2. users' content won't produce any future value, as it will be Roomba'ed days later
3. users might face an unsuspecting question ban (they don't really know a question ban exists until they actually face it)
4. if we spend five minutes writing a 400-word comment to a question, why not spend five more minutes and write an 800 word answer to their query?

So, if you're inclined to put a close vote for this reason, please don't! Instead, bookmark that question, and write an answer later.

### Short questions and low effort questions: correlation, but not a causality
  
A low effort question means not having as much effort _as required in that context._ Low effort questions being short as well is a correlation, but not a causality. Even lengthy questions may be low-effort, so we shouldn't use length as a determining factor.  
  
For example, in [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/39315/dipole-moments-of-pyrrole-and-furan), it is clear the OP understands why what he's asking is a problem in the first place. There isn't any need for elaboration. Of course, a bit of that could have helped, but that really isn't necessary. The question is salvaged and understood.  
  
[This question](https://web.archive.org/web/20180430024711/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95999/principles-of-valence-shell-electron-pair-repulsion) instead is longer, yet, is clearly an imperative homework vampire.  This is another [low effort question](http://web.archive.org/web/20180429124744/https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/95913/graph-between-compressibility-factor-and-pressure-for-real-and-ideal-gases) that I likely wouldn't want to answer, but it seems very similar to Marko's question.  It has a fundamental conceptual problem to it, better answered by a textbook/Google searches.

### **What is the philosophy/motivation behind closing low effort stuff?**

1. It helps in quality control. We want our content to be high quality or medium quality, but certainly not even 20% of it as low quality.
2. It keeps the experts coming back. High schoolers cannot shoulder the content on this site. They have way too many misconceptions,  and don't know enough details/depth in any particular topic, so it's very important to have the experts around. 

### **Verifying sufficient effort in grey-area questions:**

If we keep lax standards, we might end up like Math.SE - too many useless questions with one or two answers and zero future usefulness. However, if we don't keep any objective standard at all, we will end up confusing ourselves as before. Specific questions would be brought up on meta, why's this low effort, why isn't this low effort, would be asked again and again, exhausting ourselves out.
  
So the next problem is: **verifying sufficient effort.** The definition for effort is directly contained in "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?#But why do you want me to show effort in the first place?". We need effort to help OPs in their original conceptual queries. But, **how much effort is sufficient?** The following is an attempt at breaking down this subjective enquiry into an objective number of easy-to-follow steps:

**tl;dr**: If the OP's question can be answered by any of the credible sources and be explicitly found within thirty seconds of Googling, use a proforma comment to  put a link to that source and to request the OP to edit their question in case that doesn't answer their query, and put a CV. Or if it is a "homework vampire" question, put a CV. Otherwise, do not CV.
  
1. **If the answer can be found in a textbook, the question should probably _not_ be closed (subject to other conditions below)**. We cannot expect every second student to have access to the best book out there. Hence, even if their question is answered in a book, it's probably better to answer it, and not close, as long as they meet other requirements below.
2. **If the topic can be Googled and the answer _found_ within thirty seconds, it's probably worth a close vote. But else, definitely not.** Also, in the first case, please do put a small comment linking to a page that explains that topic (the source must be credible though¹), and ask them to show more effort. It's most annoying when we see an item in the CV queue, but have no clue why someone thought of close voting it. A small comment would help the OP as well as the CV reviewers. In the absence of such comment, CV reviewers may use their own discretion, and lean towards Leave Open. Again, this has caveats:
    1. **if the answer can be _implicitly understood_, but not _explicitly found_, on aweb article, then it's **not** worth a close vote,** as we cannot assume what is implicit to us to be implicit to everyone else.
    2. If the answer is on a non-credible site<sup>details below</sup> , do not CV it.
3. **Keep your expectations in accordance with the standard of the OP:** If the OP is a high-schooler, it would not make sense to link them to a research paper, and tell them how their question is low-effort. However, if the question is about a graduate topic, we should expect the OP to be a bit more detailed and mature in their question. 
4. **Blatant textbook problem statements in imperative speech ("homework vampires"): definitely a close-vote** We don't need to do anything apart from hammer closing them. No greetings, or welcome messages compulsory, or explanations in comments necessary.
  
Again, please use your discretion and common sense. We definitely have an influx of bad questions everyday, but we also are too trigger-happy in closing questions.<sup>stats needed, but well understood</sup> **While reviewing some stuff, if your mind stops even for a second to debate whether it's low effort or not, it's better then to not put the close vote in, and vote Leave Open.** We should lean towards the side of leaving that grey area stuff open, rather than closing on it.
  
**On having repeated meta discussions about effort:**
<sup>Not sure if this was even necessary, but I ended up putting it in anyway</sup>
Note that we don't really get anywhere by having several discussions on what is low effort and what isn't. We need to spent time writing answers instead. While we need quality control, we also need content to quality control in the first place. Unfortunately, these discussions divert the attention of people from writing answers to closing and reviewing stuff, and having discussions about it, which isn't a healthy change.  
  
The answer rates have dropped sharply<sup>[I still need stats](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/44301556#44301556)</sup>, and this isn't a good sign. Of course, this direction is slightly going off topic in this discussion, but it's worth considering that because we are too much obsessed over what content is allowed or not, rather than actually writing answers to questions that get asked. As Marko had also said:

> I've got the impression that acquiring knowledge isn't the priority here anymore, but rather following some established policies and forms.

A certain level of obsession with quality control is good, but too much of it is a diversion from our main task on this Q&A site.

So, if some question gets closed as homework, and one or two users oppose citing proper reasons as to why it isn't homework, and the position really isn't clear as both sides have convincing arguments, just vote Reopen. Daily comments like "CVers: please don't VTC; this isn't homework" or stuff like that are just more of wasted/diverted precious effort everyday that could be spent improving existing site content or writing new answers. 

However, also note that you think that a question has been left open or closed unfairly, speak up in the comments and/or bring it to meta, _but only if you start to see a pattern_. We shouldn't need to discuss each and every question that's closed, but general patterns can and should be brought up. (adapted from jonsca's original comment)

### Converting low-effort type problems into canonical questions

[thomji](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/435) made a good point:

> What if we were to adopt a policy of editing specific questions that showed no evidence of work into more general "how do I?" questions? As an example: 
> "Find the amount of  CO2  in grams that is produced when 150 grams of ethanol combusts in oxygen"
> could be rewritten into:
"How do I find the amount of  CO2  produced during a combustion reaction?"    
The question could then be answered with step-by-step examples, (using different numbers - or no numbers).

This basically goes well along "Please encourage and improve new OP's questions", however, this isn't implemented that very often on our site. We should keep this idea in mind too. Moreover, this has many advantages, as listed before:

>-   We could refer future similar questions to the generalized one
>-   They would turn up more frequently in searches
>-   A person who honestly had no idea where to start would still get help and not be run off by people who are tired of answering obvious homework problems
>-   A person who dishonestly wanted to use the site as a homework service would instead have to learn how to solve the problem (or at least work through the steps with different numbers)
>-   We would eventually develop a collection of the best answers to common types of homework problems

### On Wikipedia style questions

For example, "What is radioactivity?". Those may be closed under too too broad, as in this case, radioactivity is a too broad phenomenon, likely to fill books, not an SE answer box. For the user, it's better to narrow down to the specific query.

I mentioned this here, because it may be confused as low effort instead, which it isn't.

### On questions whose premises are fundamentally flawed from the beginning

As long as they are well-described and have a pointed answer that can be written out well, they should be **on-topic.**

The argument given against keeping them closed is that they are often too broad, however, that isn't the case. We do have a lot of long answers on the site already, and sometimes such questions can be [important](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/28864/why-are-the-axial-bonds-of-pf5-longer-than-those-of-the-equatorial-bonds-hybri). Also, RM made good points that are [found here](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3084/5026). Essentially, he said that:

> **Re-write the question to be more general** (or at the least answer as if it was).
> **Self answer to a new question.** Sometimes, though, there are multiple, unrelated confusions going on in a post, or the key confusion is something completely unrelated. If  _this_  question is too muddled to serve as a place to write a good answer to the basic question hiding within it, you can always post a new, clear question and then give your answer there. Then you can post a link to the new question in the comments/answer of the original, muddled question

Our motivation in the end to should always be to produce **quality content on our site**, so even if that means creating a self answer to a new question, we should do that, instead of quickly closing down OP's question as too broad. However, if the question can't be saved at all, then there's no point trying. In all cases, **please use your judgement, and favor producing new quality content over closing new questions.**

Another argument being given for their closure is actually  instead more applicable to chameleon question - when the OP goes beyond what was asked originally in the comments to the accepted answer. And the best strategy is that in such a case, we should politely ask them to ask a new question/drop by chat. That problem is unrelated to closure.


## Ideas that need an answer/consensus

### How can we shorten the "What effort do I need to do before asking a question?" document?

We cannot really expect the new users to read all of that. Even though it's very streamlined and contains the most essential and comprehensive information in one place, any new user will probably be intimidated by its scale.

**Proposed solution:** we don't need to link new users to that document at all in the beginning. It should only serve as a standing guide, intended to direct non-users to our general site policy. Our first pro-forma comment to a new user should be along the lines of that described under "Problem 4" above. If they get back later with a vague effort, only the point them to that policy document. If their question gets closed, they'll read the policy anyway, and if they aren't homework vampires, make necessary edits.

### How to deal with "How to" question?/"I don't understand how to do this. Help?"

The OP in such cases clearly isn't a homework vampire. They don't want to plug the values and get the answer by tonight. Rather, they took time to put up a generic enough question that could deserve a good answer, and be useful in bringing more visitors to our site.

[thomji](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/435) had an important idea here:

> If...., then we need to make the requirements very clear in the HW policy. For example "You must provide the equation and show that you can plug the appropriate numbers in" or "you must demonstrate that you can work through at least one step of the problem." The **downside to this is that we will likely discourage many people who are completely stuck and don't even know where to get started.** That might be a desired outcome, but **I believe there is value in providing "how to" examples for common problems,** in that it will draw many more users to the site, who will (hopefully) in a few years become experts themselves. (my emphasis)

We already have such "how to" questions open on our site. A good example being [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/q/58104).

They clearly don't demonstrate much effort in the sense that they themselves are the fundamental steps in understanding a concept. There's nothing below them.

However, we also don't to answer every second fundamental, and fill our site with the already good content from sites like LibreTexts or Khan Academy (for example, doing the derivation of every second equation in ionic equilibrium). That job is reserved for the other teaching sites.

**Proposed solution** The above described low-effort rules apply (under **tl;dr** above). 

<sup>debatable</sup>need a third custom close reason for this? Or will a new proforma comment be enough?

> We are not a tutoring service. Broad questions lacking clarity in understanding fundamental concepts are better answered by a teaching source like a textbook/Khan Academy/etc. If you've a specific query that isn't answered by any of these sources, please [edit] your question to detail that.

### Reopens don't always succeed, even in clear cut cases. Flag them for mod-reopening?

Mods do drop by time to time in the reopen queue, and hammer reopen "homework" closed questions (and quite rightly so) that have been later edited. (or were wrongly closed). It would be nice to hear of an exact policy they would want us to follow though in case the reopen fails as well.

### How to deal with honest questions from people with non-chemistry background working in other industries?

> For example, [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/40840/how-to-calculate-the-amount-of-citric-acid-to-neutralise-the-ph-within-wastewate). OP didn't do much research before posting the question, so from one perspective the question could be closed by the [extended "homework" VTC reason](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/142/11367). However, the question clearly derives from someone's industrial experience, and perhaps they don't have much of a chemistry background or have much interest in learning chemistry for chemistry's sake. Does that mean we should answer, even in the face of the lack of research, since it's a real-world problem that someone has encountered? Or should, e.g., a potential lack of interest in the chemistry on the part of the OP bias us even more strongly toward closure?

([hBy2Py/Brian](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3187))

Do we hold them to the same standards as we expect normal chemistry questions to be? Obviously, this would alienate our community to people with not a good chemistry background, which is bad.

**Proposed solution:**

Be lenient on them. As long as they are well-described and straightforward, leave them open. They aren't clearly an "homework assignment". We don't have an influx of hundreds of industrial questions at this point, so we can let them be open.

### Possibly review this again - AMIRITE questions?

We could review the two old policies we already have, because they written in the homework-era of our site. [one](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1626/what-should-be-done-with-is-my-calculation-correct-type-questions) and [two](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3396/policy-on-amirite-questions?noredirect=1&lq=1)

Also, good thoughts:

> "check my math" questions should be closed, but ones along the lines of "did I set this up right?" or "am I using this equation correctly?" may provide useful material. The difficult ones are actually when they  _have_  done it correctly, because then there's not much to post as an answer but "Yes," except in cases, e.g., where OP has some uncertainties or ancillary questions that can be addressed. ([hBy2Py/Brian](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3181/lets-decide-on-what-we-should-close-as-homework#comment2985_3183))

### Possibly review these again - Data request questions?

Last policy discussion was [in '16](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/should-we-allow-data-questions). However, there definitely doesn't seem to be some consensus there.

**New proposed solution:**

1. third custom close reason: plain straightforward data mining requests are off-topic. (similar to that on German.SE, dictionary/thesaurus requests are offtopic)
2. a reference wiki post on our main site on where to look for different types of data (acidity tables/etc.) (which we should also cite in our custom close reason in point 1)
3. However, if the question has **some genuine premises** (as was the case in [this question](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/92507/a-basic-question-about-tetramethylammonium-hydroxide), or as described in [andselisk's answer](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3875)), which cannot be helped by the reference wiki post we would have on our main site, we shouldn't close them as data mining off topic.

### **The obvious stuff**:

1. Once we decide on this policy, we should ensure that the active CV reviewers follow them correctly, which I hope would be easy enough. 
2. more?

### **Sources we consider credible (that we expect readers to check out before asking a question)**

Of course, no source can be 100% credible (not even our own site), but based on factors like readership, moderation activity, we can expect the following sources to be reliable:

1. LibreTexts
2. ChemGuide
3. Any research paper published in Wiley/Elsevier/Nature/other popular publishing houses
4. add more?

The following are disputed as reliable sources:

1. Quora: especially as it is just forum site, so, the knowledge that's on that site must originate from another original paper/article/etc. It's probably better to look for that original paper instead. Also, its content is locked behind a signup-wall.
2. Meritnation/askIITians or other flourishing Indian coaching websites
