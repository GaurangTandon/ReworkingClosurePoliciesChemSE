These are some more tangential ideas to keep in mind, moved from the main file to keep it short:

### Please don't VTC because a question is poorly formatted. Rather, encourage and improve new OP's questions
Well, this is probably tangential, but let's just repeat it. The idea of showing "effort" might entirely be foreign to new users.  They might be used to dumping questions to their tutor first, and then being guided step-by-step later. So, please use the ProFormaTemplates comments (or whichever way you find appropriate) to request them for elaboration. Of course, seeing several bad questions in a day might leave a bad taste, but we must assume good intentions from and be nice to new posters, every single time. If we are tired/worn out, we should probably skip reviewing stuff that day.

Moreover, fixing MathJax /formatting is an important issue. **If you are inclined to put a close vote just because a question is poorly formatted, it's a big NO!** Consider editing the OP's question instead to make it clearer. If it still misses out one or more fronts (too broad/opinion based/low-effort/etc.), feel free to VTC it. However, **if you're too busy to edit, just skip the close vote.** We all have priorities, and there's no harm in skipping an edit if you aren't comfortable completing it. However, **VTCing just based on the formatting should be a big NO**.

### Please don't VTC because a question's easy and got answered in comments

[It happens frequently.](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/43872590#43872590)

OP's easy question first receives two-three comments pointing them in the right direction. And then the homework CVs, etc. start being applied to that question, as discussed in the main post above. So, if you're inclined to put a close vote for this reason, please don't. Instead, bookmark that question, and write an answer later. And do vote Leave Open.

**On having repeated meta discussions about effort:**
<sup>Not sure if this was even necessary, but I ended up putting it in anyway</sup>
Note that we don't really get anywhere by having several discussions on what is low effort and what isn't. We need to spent time writing answers instead. While we need quality control, we also need content to quality control in the first place. Unfortunately, these discussions divert the attention of people from writing answers to closing and reviewing stuff, and having discussions about it, which isn't a healthy change.  
  
The answer rates have dropped sharply<sup>[I still need stats](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/44301556#44301556)</sup>, and this isn't a good sign. Of course, this direction is slightly going off topic in this discussion, but it's worth considering that because we are too much obsessed over what content is allowed or not, rather than actually writing answers to questions that get asked. As Marko had also said:

> I've got the impression that acquiring knowledge isn't the priority here anymore, but rather following some established policies and forms.

A certain level of obsession with quality control is good, but too much of it is a diversion from our main task on this Q&A site.

So, if some question gets closed as homework, and one or two users oppose citing proper reasons as to why it isn't homework, and the position really isn't clear as both sides have convincing arguments, just vote Reopen. Daily comments like "CVers: please don't VTC; this isn't homework" or stuff like that are just more of wasted/diverted precious effort everyday that could be spent improving existing site content or writing new answers. 

However, also note that you think that a question has been left open or closed unfairly, speak up in the comments and/or bring it to meta, _but only if you start to see a pattern_. We shouldn't need to discuss each and every question that's closed, but general patterns can and should be brought up. (adapted from jonsca's original comment)

### Converting low-effort type problems into canonical questions

[thomji](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/435) made a good point:

> What if we were to adopt a policy of editing specific questions that showed no evidence of work into more general "how do I?" questions? As an example: 
> "Find the amount of  CO2  in grams that is produced when 150 grams of ethanol combusts in oxygen"
> could be rewritten into:
"How do I find the amount of  CO2  produced during a combustion reaction?"    
The question could then be answered with step-by-step examples, (using different numbers - or no numbers).

This basically goes well along "Please encourage and improve new OP's questions", however, this isn't implemented that very often on our site. We should keep this idea in mind too. Moreover, this has many advantages, as listed before:

>-   We could refer future similar questions to the generalized one
>-   They would turn up more frequently in searches
>-   A person who honestly had no idea where to start would still get help and not be run off by people who are tired of answering obvious homework problems
>-   A person who dishonestly wanted to use the site as a homework service would instead have to learn how to solve the problem (or at least work through the steps with different numbers)
>-   We would eventually develop a collection of the best answers to common types of homework problems

### On Wikipedia style questions

For example, "What is radioactivity?". Those may be closed under too too broad, as in this case, radioactivity is a too broad phenomenon, likely to fill books, not an SE answer box. For the user, it's better to narrow down to the specific query.

I mentioned this here, because it may be confused as low effort instead, which it isn't.

### On questions whose premises are fundamentally flawed from the beginning

As long as they are well-described and have a pointed answer that can be written out well, they should be **on-topic.**

The argument given against keeping them closed is that they are often too broad, however, that isn't the case. We do have a lot of long answers on the site already, and sometimes such questions can be [important](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/28864/why-are-the-axial-bonds-of-pf5-longer-than-those-of-the-equatorial-bonds-hybri). Also, RM made good points that are [found here](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3084/5026). Essentially, he said that:

> **Re-write the question to be more general** (or at the least answer as if it was).
> **Self answer to a new question.** Sometimes, though, there are multiple, unrelated confusions going on in a post, or the key confusion is something completely unrelated. If  _this_  question is too muddled to serve as a place to write a good answer to the basic question hiding within it, you can always post a new, clear question and then give your answer there. Then you can post a link to the new question in the comments/answer of the original, muddled question

Our motivation in the end to should always be to produce **quality content on our site**, so even if that means creating a self answer to a new question, we should do that, instead of quickly closing down OP's question as too broad. However, if the question can't be saved at all, then there's no point trying. In all cases, **please use your judgement, and favor producing new quality content over closing new questions.**

Another argument being given for their closure is actually  instead more applicable to chameleon question - when the OP goes beyond what was asked originally in the comments to the accepted answer. And the best strategy is that in such a case, we should politely ask them to ask a new question/drop by chat. That problem is unrelated to closure.
