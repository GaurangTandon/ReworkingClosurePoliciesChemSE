**tl;dr** The homework FAQ post was created for textbook questions _only_ (where the "homework" makes sense), but later it got applied to every second question that lacked effort (and wasn't textbook homework). So, instead of creating a new FAQ, somehow people thought it good to expand upon the original one instead and yet retain the word "homework", and confuse generations of OPs.

**Longer:**  [Math.SE originated](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/1804/1)  the first usage of "homework" - and quite correctly. Their "homework" literally meant textbook problems that students needed help with.

Two months later,  [Phy.SE](https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/revisions/715/1)  somehow considered it appropriate to also merge "self-study problems, puzzles" along with it - ruining the definition of the word homework, and sowing seeds of confusion that would irritate OPs for close to a decade now!

And since our former leader ManishEarth was a Phy.SE veteran, our community also followed almost exactly the same guidelines as were set in Phy.SE.

Finally, since the last five years, we haven't really [any major changes](https://chemistry.meta.stackexchange.com/posts/142/revisions) to the homework policy. The most major, yet most obvious, though came quite recently on April 21 (hint answers were not a frequent problem anyway, so the policy still removing it out was good, sine we already have had some consensus on it).
